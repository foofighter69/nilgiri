#summary wxLua 2.8.10.0 builds

= Introduction =

My goal is to build wxLua with normal utf8 display. The official build is perfect for linux, but fails on windows.


= Details =

Available wxLua builds for windows:

[1] Official build, http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxlua/wxLua-2.8.10.0-MSW-bin.zip
[2] Bagheadspidey's build, http://baghead.drdteam.org/apps/doomcrap-0.1.4.zip?nocache1
[3] My wxLua 2.8.10.0 mingw build 

    | label | xrc | txtctrl input |
[1] |   a   |  a  |       a       |
[2] |   u   |  a  |       a       |
[3] |   a   |  u  |       a       |
